  ## Description
  
This app tracks notes that you take and allows you reference them later. You can also delete them once you're done. The notes will persist after you leave the site, as they're stored on an internal JSON file and can be reread at any time.
  
  ## Installation
  
You will need to install node.js, inquirer, and express to run this program. 
  
  ## Usage
  
As currently written, you'll need to run node server.js from the js folder in the console, then go to localhost:3000 in your browser. This will bring you to the starting page of the app.
